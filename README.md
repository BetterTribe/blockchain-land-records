# Land Records on Blockchain

Experimental system for storing land records on public blockchains using smart contracts

Each land owner has a public record of their land stored on a public blockchain. Through Public Key Cryptography, Each owner has complete control on modifications of the data about his/her land on the chain. Any modification like change in ownership has to be signed by the current land record owner. These land record contracts can be approved by the governments and the fees charged for data modifications can be used as tax savings which should obvioulsy be approved by the governing bodies.

This system has its drawbacks like a user's private key might be compromised and the thief can change the land record to its own name. The land owner who is the only person with the knowledge of private key might die.

This is an experimental technology. A better system would require the signatures of two or more parties to perform any modification like signature of a government appointed agent and the land owner's signature.
